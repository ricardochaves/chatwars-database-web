## About the game

It`s a [Telegram chatbot game](https://telegram.me/chtwrsbot?start=f71c9cd581c94906ad95899798a21146)

## Motivation

I'm trying to get a little closer to React. I decided to develop something fun to help with my studies.

## Need help

This code was made by someone who does not know the framework. It's being my first contact with Next.js. So if you liked the project and want to help, feel free to restructure the project in any way you think is best.

## Stat project

Create a `config.json` with the valus of your Auth0 account.

```json
{
  "AUTH0_CLIENT_ID": "gUo8Ek3j4k5YrXA1E73fjk34bvD3xbHQA",
  "AUTH0_CLIENT_DOMAIN": "yourdomain.auth0.com",
  "API_HOST": "http://0.0.0.0:5005/api/v1/"
}
```

You will need run the API to load data. TODO
